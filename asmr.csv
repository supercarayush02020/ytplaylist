"✨Remove Dark Entities, Bad Luck, Energy Parasites & Negative Influences Reiki Energy Meditation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3An9z_rhJg,"Remove Dark Entities, Bad Luck, Energy Parasites & Negative Influences Reiki Energy Meditation

My intention for this Remove Dark Entities, Bad Luck, Energy Parasites & Negative Influences Reiki session is to remove any negative spirits that have latched to you. If you are struggling with life disruptions such as bad luck, constant lack of energy, chronic aches, mood swings, negative thoughts, sleep issues (including nightmares) or other unexplained struggles. There might be some dark spirit or energy parasite attachment on you. These dark entities can latch themselves onto you when your frequency is low, such as when you are feeling sad or depressed for example. If you want to, I can help to release all negative entities from your system, so you can go back to your state of well-being. I will be using a Reiki Technique that can clear them for you and fill your body with light. I also added the ""frequency of God"" healing music for your benefit. All released energies are sent to the Light of Source or to Mother Earth for transmutation. Each person receives the energy in their own sovereign space, without any entanglement.
With so much love and light.

Whispers from Heaven (1111 Hz) | 1 hour handpan music | Malte Marten & Lynxk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnhmqWqs7kI,"I deeply believe into the concept of „growing together“. We all bring so many different experiences, strengths, wounds, patterns and beliefs into our relationships. It’s not about being perfect, but about the willingness to learn together and outgrow our own limitations. 
Let’s be compassionate with ourselves and others. We are fallen angels and here to serve.

1 Hour of Peaceful Ocean Harp Music | Sarah Bhalla,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnuPTeyvm2c,"Just as I arrived at the shore, the sun broke through the clouds, casting a warm golden glow. The waves crashed in rhythm, and the gentle breeze danced through the harp strings. In that incredible moment, I felt deeply grateful for these pure, beautiful gifts of nature. I’m so thankful to share this experience, a serene blend of music and the natural world.

All of the music is improvised around a few compositional ideas, played intuitively, flowing with the rhythm of this peaceful space.

Love to you,

Sarah

What is ASMR?
It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Most people experience ASMR in the form of tingles, which is often described as an electrifying sensation down your back. It's very relaxing and comforting but it can go as far as to help with anxiety, sleeping problems and stress. Though ASMR is not a medical treatment and I do not give medical advice.

What mics am I using?
the single mic - Blue Yeti X
the two small ones on a stand - Rode M5-MP
the one that looks like some sort of ghost hunting device - Zoom H5 and SSH-6 capsule
mic with ears - 3Dio FS XLR

Om Shanti ॐ 1 hour Healing Angelic Music - Mantra for Peace,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQLx-Hi6Ga0,"This mantra carries the healing frequency of peace.
It helps you find a sense of calm and peace within yourself, no matter what is going on around you.

We invite you to take a deep breath and let these healing vibrations balance your body, mind and soul.

We composed this melody a while ago and felt that now is the time to share it with the world.

With this offering, we pray for peace and unity in the world.
May we remember that we all came from and will all return to the same source.
May we feel the interconnectedness between all of life.
May we be kind to ourselves and each other.

With love,
Clara & Yuval

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

What is ASMR?
It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Most people experience ASMR in the form of tingles, which is often described as an electrifying sensation down your back. It's very relaxing and comforting but it can go as far as to help with anxiety, sleeping problems and stress. Though ASMR is not a medical treatment and I do not give medical advice.

What mics am I using?
the single mic - Blue Yeti X
the two small ones on a stand - Rode M5-MP
the one that looks like some sort of ghost hunting device - Zoom H5 and SSH-6 capsule
mic with ears - 3Dio FS XLR

I am Sanne, a Swedish Witch, Energy Master, and Spiritual Guide, working with the sacred currents flowing through the ancient lands of the North.

Like the Völvas before me, I weave together ancestral knowledge, psychic vision, and energy mastery to create powerful healing transmissions.

🧙‍♀️ About Me 🧙‍♀️
I’m Sanne, a Nordic Witch, Psychic Medium, and Energy Master, guiding seekers and healers to reclaim their spiritual gifts. For over a decade, I have worked with thousands of clients and students worldwide, teaching:
✨ Nordic Shamanic Healing (Völva traditions & ancestral energy work)
🌿 Angelic & Reiki Healing
🌀 Somatic Healing & Hypnosis
🔮 Soul Coaching & Psychic Development
Through my work, I bridge ancient wisdom with modern spirituality, empowering healers to rise.

🌿 FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions 🌿

🔹 Tell me about your head jewelry?
The headpiece I wear is from Etsy and looks similar to the jewelry found in Viking graves across Sweden, inspired by Roman & Byzantine coin designs used in Norse craftsmanship.

🔹 What do the runes on your hands mean?
I use different Nordic runes to create a protective field around me when I work. Some of the runes I use:
Algiz (ᛉ) – Protection
Uruz (ᚢ) – Strength
Sowilo (ᛋ) – Success

🔹 Can anyone learn this type of energy healing, or do you need to be from the Nordics?
This practice is not closed—if you feel called to this energy, you can learn it. Having Northern European ancestry can deepen your connection, but it is not a requirement. Energy recognizes resonance, not borders.

🔹 How should I watch the video for best success?
Listen to your intuition! 
🌿 Some people prefer to:
Watch my hand movements and follow along visually.
Lie down, close their eyes, and receive the energy.
Keep it on in the background while doing daily tasks.
There is no right or wrong—experiment and notice how your body responds. 🌿✨

What is ASMR?
It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Most people experience ASMR in the form of tingles, which is often described as an electrifying sensation down your back. It's very relaxing and comforting but it can go as far as to help with anxiety, sleeping problems and stress. Though ASMR is not a medical treatment and I do not give medical advice.

What mics am I using?
the single mic - Blue Yeti X
the two small ones on a stand - Rode M5-MP
the one that looks like some sort of ghost hunting device - Zoom H5 and SSH-6 capsule
mic with ears - 3Dio FS XLR

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

Ultimate Spiritual Detox | Negative Energy Removal + Divine Energy Activation ✨ Witch Healing ASMR,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Hti7dou_E,"First Steps to Become an Energy Healer: Free Masterclass ➝ https://home.sannethewitch.com/masterclasswelcome

🧙‍♀️ Nordic Energy Healing | The Art of Ancient Witchcraft 🌿✨

This Nordic Shamanic Energy Healing is rooted in the traditions of the Viking Witches, the Völvas—mystics, seers, and energy workers who channeled the power of the land. I am Sanne, a Swedish Witch, Energy Master, and Spiritual Guide, working with the sacred currents flowing through the ancient lands of the North.

Like the Völvas before me, I weave together ancestral knowledge, psychic vision, and energy mastery to create powerful healing transmissions.

🧙‍♀️ About Me 🧙‍♀️
I’m Sanne, a Nordic Witch, Psychic Medium, and Energy Master, guiding seekers and healers to reclaim their spiritual gifts. For over a decade, I have worked with thousands of clients and students worldwide, teaching:
✨ Nordic Shamanic Healing (Völva traditions & ancestral energy work)
🌿 Angelic & Reiki Healing
🌀 Somatic Healing & Hypnosis
🔮 Soul Coaching & Psychic Development
Through my work, I bridge ancient wisdom with modern spirituality, empowering healers to rise.

🌿 FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions 🌿
🔹 Tell me about your head jewelry?
The headpiece I wear is from Etsy and looks similar to the jewelry found in Viking graves across Sweden, inspired by Roman & Byzantine coin designs used in Norse craftsmanship.
🔹 What do the runes on your hands mean?
I use different Nordic runes to create a protective field around me when I work. Some of the runes I use:
* Algiz (ᛉ) – Protection
* Uruz (ᚢ) – Strength
* Sowilo (ᛋ) – Success
🔹 Can anyone learn this type of energy healing, or do you need to be from the Nordics?
This practice is not closed—if you feel called to this energy, you can learn it. Having Northern European ancestry can deepen your connection, but it is not a requirement. Energy recognizes resonance, not borders.
🔹 How should I watch the video for best success?
Listen to your intuition! 
🌿 Some people prefer to:
* Watch my hand movements and follow along visually.
* Lie down, close their eyes, and receive the energy.
* Keep it on in the background while doing daily tasks.
There is no right or wrong—experiment and notice how your body responds. 🌿✨

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

[ ASMR NO TALKING ]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVEz3Kbmulw,"Today only dry hand sounds and hand movements very close to the camera, no talking ASMR, and with a dark background so you can use it to focus on a task, study, gaming, work, or if you just want to listen to some relaxing sounds, close your eyes and sleep. The first videos on the channel (for those who have been here since the beginning) were recorded this way because I still didn't dare to show my face here hehe. Within the hand sounds, you will also see finger snapping and finger fluttering. 
I hope you have a good night or a little time to relax.
Stay safe and see you soon.

According to Dictionary.com, Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a calming, pleasurable feeling often accompanied by a tingling sensation. This tingle is said to originate in a person’s head and spread to the spine (and sometimes the limbs) in response to stimulation. The stimuli that trigger ASMR vary from person to person. Some of the most common ones include whispers, white noise, lip smacking, having a person’s complete attention (as in having one’s hair cut by a hairdresser), as well as brushing, chewing, tapping, scratching, and crinkling. ~

We’ll stroll along the picturesque banks of the Volga River, experience a real Russian banya, and have some fun with my friends at a cozy camping spot in the forest. Be ready to get acquainted with the authentic soup called okroshka, discover the secret of perfectly cooked shashlik, and meet my Russian babushka!

Today, let me cut your hair like a pro hair stylist ✂ It's been almost six months since I uploaded the last hair cut video. Some people have leaved still comments on my previous haircut videos. I'm so thankful. They said they liked my video because it was realistic. So, I practiced hard to do the same hand gestures as real hairdressers while watching actual haircut videos to shoot this video. I hope you like it. Then see you in the next video. Goodnight💋

Today I'm gettin' ALL UP IN YOUR EARS :D Normally I've done deep whispers like this with the 3Dio, but with you all liking my latest 100% sensitivity series with the rode nt1's, I decided to try it with them this time! I love the Rode's,  they're super crisp and have barely any white noise. So in this viddie I get up-close to the mic, cupping the mic with my hand for an even ~deeper~ effect, and switch between articulated and breathy whispers! Throwing in my new ""manual echo"" trigger, too! I hope you tingle LOTS, enjoy the rambles and get some much needed rest :) Thanks for being here!!

If the video seems similar in triggers and nature to a previous one it is because I had this idea and filmed it Twice thinking that this one came out way to dark! 
But to my surprise it isn't and it is such a dreamy atmosphere with this sunset.

1 Hour of Heavenly Harp Music I Sarah Bhalla,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98F4_WyYyVk,"I had been actively watching the weather, hoping the rain would hold off just long enough before the approaching storm rolled in from across the ocean. As I made my way to the cliffs, I passed through golden fields of mustard flowers, where a lone crane stood gracefully in the distance. The air was still, the calm before the storm. This was a beautiful session, and I hope you can feel the deep peace woven into these moments.

Just as I packed up my harp and started walking back, the first raindrops fell, a soft, gentle prelude to what was coming. By the time I reached the car and loaded everything, the rain had just begun a gentle shower, sweeping across the landscape I had just left behind. I sat for a moment, letting gratitude to God settle over me, a quiet acknowledgment that everything had unfolded at the perfect time.

All of the music is improvised around a few compositional ideas, played intuitively, flowing with the rhythm of this magnificent space.

Love to you,

Sarah

The real-world consequences of global aid cuts.

Political tensions and calls for accountability.

Corruption scandals and the fight for transparency.

And much more—all delivered in a gentle, tingle-inducing whisper.

✨ ASMR serious news stories but it's oddly satisfying ✨,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-53FPx_Jw3w,"Welcome to ASMR Newsroom, where gentle whispers and calm reflections help us navigate today’s complex headlines. In this soothing update, I’ll share important stories with both compassion and clarity, inviting you to pause, breathe deeply, and join in thoughtful reflection on our world. In today’s video, you’ll hear:

• How drastic cuts in funding for school programs and the mass exodus of public service employees threaten our children’s future, and what that means for communities that depend on essential support systems.
• A look at the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, where every missile and drone is a reminder of how fragile peace truly is.
• Deep concerns over government overreach, corporate interests, privatization, and a partisan continuing resolution that has left many progressive voices, including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, feeling betrayed.
• The unsettling deportation of hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador, despite judicial orders meant to protect basic rights, and the human cost visible in every shackle and bus convoy.
• And crucially, startling polling numbers reveal that support for both the Democratic Party and Donald Trump is collapsing. With the Democrats’ favorability at historic lows and Trump’s approval ratings plummeting amid economic and foreign policy missteps, it’s clear that both sides are struggling to connect with everyday Americans.
• This moment underscores a vital call to action: the democratic party must open its doors to bolder, progressive voices that truly champion working people, fight for economic justice, and challenge the billionaire interests squeezing the middle class.

If you’re seeking a space to stay informed and find your inner calm amid these turbulent times, you’ve come to the right place. Let these soft-spoken updates remind you that even in the face of daunting challenges, compassion and unity can light the way toward a fairer, more equitable world.

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

"[ASMR] Deep Breathy Whispers, Blowing, Brushing ❤️",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeuFAHGypWE,"HELLO ANGELS  🤗❤️

And welcome back to another video!! TODAY I BRING BACK MR. YETI 🤍 The Yamaha mixer that has been serving me well these past years BROKE :'( so I decided to sit down and figure out how to use the Rodecaster Pro 2... which is not noob friendly. Long story short, I got frustrated and gave up. So I whipped out my ol' reliable blue yeti and filmed this video instead :) We love u you Mr. Yeti 🤍

Since filming this, I THINK I figured out how to used the rodecaster... I'm going to try it for ASMR Monday tomorrow which will be streamed on both my angelskimi twitch channel AND my angelskimi youtube channel!!! Trying out multi streaming for my first time :D I want to keep this ASMR channel youtube exclusive content, and will make the angelskimi youtube channel a collection of everything else! Oh my... come to think of it, I'm not sure if I should be trying out my new mixer AND multi streaming at the same time. I meeaaaaaaaaaan what's the worst that can happen HAHA *knocks on wood*

Anywho, thank you everyone for letting me figure out balance between ASMR video uploads, streaming, candles, etc. And for being encouraging of all my little projects :') 🤍

I hope this video brings you some comfort and I'll see you soon,
xoKimi

ASMR Monday 8pm pst tomorrow on twitch.tv/angelskimi

What is ASMR??
ASMR stands for Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). 
It is a feeling of well-being combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck, as experienced by some people in response to a specific gentle stimulus, often a particular sound.

PLEASE NOTE: Even though ASMR can help you relax, it is in NO WAY a substitute for medical/psychological counsel, please reach out to your doctor if you're in need of medical support.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3rAsyq5DIhQ/sddefault.jpg,tiny hands ASMR,"1 Hours, 58 Minutes, 37 Seconds",2024-07-18T19:00:02

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

🦋 About me 🦋

Hello fellow humans! My name is Silke (pronounced Silk-a) and I am a Level 2 Reiki practitioner currently living in England. I dream of moving somewhere tropical, buying a little cabin and living off the land. Besides making ASMR videos I love keeping my hands busy with pottery, drawing and painting.

I really enjoyed filming this one :) 

honestly I like these videos because I enjoy getting to use all the different products I’ve accumulated over the years lol. ￼

getting to use props I don’t normally get to use makes me feel refreshed, and makes recording a bit more fun imo 

anyways, no one asked for the video - but I still hope you enjoy it 🌱

Тебя снова ПОЙМАЛИ 🥺 | АСМР В плену Наги 🐍 | Под чарами змеи | 1000% Мурашки 🤤,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q_rWWUGa_Q,"Ты снова попался! Ты смог сбежать от Волчицы, смогу улизнуть от Нимфы. Но что теперь? На твоем пути встретилась невероятно  мудрая и жестокая Нага. Она окутала тебя своим шупотем, обвила хвостом и никуда не отпустит! Как тебе выбраться из ее чар?!

Если вы ПОТЕРЯЛИ способность чувствовать мурашки, то дам ряд небольших советов, которые помогают мне исправить это:

1) Попробуйте поиграть с громкостью видео. Возможно любимое видео на высокой/низкой громкости даст новые эмоции.
2) Продублируйте видео в двух вкладках с разницей в 1-5 минут. Это придаст ощущение многослойности любимых звуков.
3) Сделайте перерыв от любимых триггеров. Ищите новые, не бойтесь пробовать смотреть то, что раньше не нравилось
4) Испробуйте разные наушники. Звук во ""кладышах"" и игровых наушниках (которые закрывают все ухо) отличается. Возможно любимые видео заиграют новыми красками.
5) Включите 2 любимых (разных) видео одновременно
6) Измените скорость воспроизведения видео


Перед просмотром необходимо надеть наушники для получения бОльших мурашек 🥰

The Perfect Bedtime Sound Bath,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BlO514Iwvo,"✨ If you want the SAME singing bowls I use in all of my videos, I’ve created Exact Pitch singing bowls that are twice as accurate as perfect pitch: https://shop.healingvibrationsmusic.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=yto&utm_content=sv

This 8 hour, bedtime sound bath was designed to calm the mind for the perfect transition to dreamland.

🏮 The low lighting dims slowly over the course of the first hour so that you will fall asleep fast and stay asleep.
🛌 The gentlest taps of the singing bowls will serve to ease the mind and stimulate the types of thoughts that will soon become your dreams.
💜 The color purple is known to create a sense of calm.
🚫 There are no commercials for the entire 8 hours.

We hope you achieve deep, pure sleep and awake feeling rested, healthy, and energized. If you like the video please subscribe for more.

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

🧙‍♀️ Nordic Energy Healing | The Art of Ancient Witchcraft 🌿✨

This Nordic Shamanic Energy Healing is rooted in the traditions of the Viking Witches, the Völvas—mystics, seers, and energy workers who channeled the power of the land. 

I am Sanne, a Swedish Witch, Energy Master, and Spiritual Guide, working with the sacred currents flowing through the ancient lands of the North.

Like the Völvas before me, I weave together ancestral knowledge, psychic vision, and energy mastery to create powerful healing transmissions.

🧙‍♀️ About Me 🧙‍♀️
I’m Sanne, a Nordic Witch, Psychic Medium, and Energy Master, guiding seekers and healers to reclaim their spiritual gifts. For over a decade, I have worked with thousands of clients and students worldwide, teaching:
✨ Nordic Shamanic Healing (Völva traditions & ancestral energy work)
🌿 Angelic & Reiki Healing
🌀 Somatic Healing & Hypnosis
🔮 Soul Coaching & Psychic Development
Through my work, I bridge ancient wisdom with modern spirituality, empowering healers to rise.

🌿 FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions 🌿

🔹 Tell me about your head jewelry?
The headpiece I wear is from Etsy and looks similar to the jewelry found in Viking graves across Sweden, inspired by Roman & Byzantine coin designs used in Norse craftsmanship.

🔹 What do the runes on your hands mean?
I use different Nordic runes to create a protective field around me when I work. Some of the runes I use:
* Algiz (ᛉ) – Protection
* Uruz (ᚢ) – Strength
* Sowilo (ᛋ) – Success

🔹 Can anyone learn this type of energy healing, or do you need to be from the Nordics?
This practice is not closed—if you feel called to this energy, you can learn it. Having Northern European ancestry can deepen your connection, but it is not a requirement. Energy recognizes resonance, not borders.

🔹 How should I watch the video for best success?
Listen to your intuition! 
🌿 Some people prefer to:
* Watch my hand movements and follow along visually.
* Lie down, close their eyes, and receive the energy.
* Keep it on in the background while doing daily tasks.
There is no right or wrong—experiment and notice how your body responds. 🌿✨

🧿Powerful Evil Eye⚡️Black Magic💥Other Attacks Removal Reiki,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGSch3jhqYo,"In this session we are using Reiki healing energy to remove evil eye, black magic or any types of energetic attacks such as psychic attacks, hexes, curses, jinx, spells, etc. These forms of strikes are very real and can have a destructive effect on you.  If you are experiencing unexplainable chronic fatigue, illnesses, anxiety, fear, desperation, negative thoughts, nightmares, constant conflicts or other form of physical or mental problems,  then perhaps you might be affected by negative energies sent by someone who does not wish you well. By the end of the session, the divine light of Reiki energy will have removed them all for you, so you can live peacefully.
I am using a spiral selenite wand to remove the unwanted attacks. The extremely high vibes of this crystal is making it a powerful tool for clearing and purifying rituals ✨All removed dark energies are being transmuted to the light from source and the violet flame 🌟 Each person receives the energy in their own sovereign space, without any entanglement.

I hope you benefit from this session and I am sending you much love & light 💜

"ASMR Focused Reiki Healing, Relaxing Energy Cleansing",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWdFnzlc5co,"Welcome back to OUR channel everyone! If you’re new here, I’d like to welcome you to our family, and I encourage you to introduce yourself below. We sound like a cult, because we probably are. 

It’s been a long time, but today you’ll see! It’s time for another Reiki session. The difference between today’s Reiki sessions and my other ones, is that I use a small bit of hypnosis technique for an additional sleepy effect. I planned on doing this bit without showing my face, but it’s been commented that many of you feel more connected when showing myself. So with that being said.. you know what to do! Pause me! Sit back, relax.. and let me make you stress free for the Holidays. I LOVE you, with ALL of my person, and I will see you tomorrow family.

📲WHAT IS THIS?
The spiritual cleansing is perhaps the most widespread tradition in the Ecuadoran Sierra when it comes to seeking health, economic prosperity, family  and more blessings in the year, to get rid of bad energy.

📲WHEN I SHOULD DO THIS?
After accidents, car crashes, having been near dead, when they steal, that gives him bad energy and for that you have to make a good clean with herbs, eggs and of colonies.

📲HEALERS
The art of cleaning is inherited or learned from a young age. Before started it, the cleaner must ensure that he is at peace with all his fellow men so that the bad energy expelled does not enter other beings. You should also know the properties of each herb well.

📲PLANTS
The plants for the clean ones are: Santamaria, Rue, Simbalo, Eucalyptus, Elder, etc.
However, there are also sweet plants, which are: lemon verbena, chamomile, sweet basil a walnut.
The most common titer ones are: rue, rosemary, thyme, drunkenness, hemlock among others.
The plants for hot baths are: matico, walnut, grouper, cypress and eucalyptus.

📲EVIL
The evil eye is when children are restless or when adults are stressed or in a bad mood. There are even discomforts in the stomach.The fright is when they can't sleep and are extremely restless.

"🔮 Spooky Hypnotic Sleep Spell 🪶✨ (Inaudible Whispers, Layered Soundscapes, Personal Attention ASMR)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM70Hnm0XkI,"📖 Let me look in my spell book for a brain melting sleep spell for you…ah, here’s the one! 🧡

🦇 For spooky season, this video theme is darker and more intense than some of my past ones. You will find the return of some old favorite visuals: Fiber optic wands! Feathers! Bubble wand! Then there are a few new guys, like the prism wand and palmistry hand. 🎃

🕯️ Additionally, I’ve added extra whispers for you this time. As always, let me note that in any of the unintelligible/inaudible whispering, I was saying nothing in particular but wanted to make it sound a bit like a magical language or spell. So, if I said anything that sounds like a word in English or another language, it was completely unintentional and purely coincidental.

Hope you find this one tingly! Enjoy! Until next time, stay well, stay well-rested, and take good care, friends! 💜

🌀Full Body Healing & Repair with Reiki Energy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdQKMxxAoZc,"In this session of Full Body Healing & Repair, I am using Reiki to send energy healing to your entire body. This will enhance your body’s natural ability to repair and heal itself. My intention for this session is to work on the part of your body that needs the most attention first. You can also set your own intention into this healing session if you wish. I will be removing negative energy and blockages that are interfering with your optimal health. Reiki energy is always for your highest good and cannot do harm. To amplify this healing, I am using a Merkaba Larvikite. This sacred geometry shape enhances our natural healing abilities.

What is ASMR? 
Autonomous sensory meridian response, sometimes auto sensory meridian response, is a tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. A pleasant form of paresthesia, it has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia and may overlap with frisson.

"ASMR Hand Sounds and Plucking Negative Energy for Sleep ✨ Hand Movements, Minimal Talking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXbg2q2ozwY,"Plucking is my go-to visual trigger to calm down and fall asleep. Sometimes I use plucking asmr videos for stress, anxiety, and hard times, which is 100% effective for me, cause it keeps my mind distracted from whatever my brain keeps me overthinking. But for sure, when plucking hand movements contains hand sounds, in some way it is so relaxing, mainly if it follows mouth sounds.
ASMR triggers you will see here: hand movements close to the camera, hand sounds, tongue clicking, mouth sounds, finger fluttering, plucking hand movements, and whispering. I hope I managed to take good care of you and that you have a great night's sleep (or that you're feeling calmer). Also, it's so cozy when ASMR follows a dark background 🙌

PS: In case you are having a hard time, know that you are not alone. Day after day, don't worry, it will get better 💜

I've also included a lot of positive and anxiety relief affirmations so you can hopefully let go of whatever is weighing your mind, and more easily drift off to sleep!
Video runs first with gentle rain sounds, and repeats with pure whispers only, so you can choose the version you prefer.
Hope you enjoy 💖

🧙‍♀️ About Me 🧙‍♀️
I’m Sanne, a Nordic Witch, Psychic Medium, and Energy Master, guiding seekers and healers to reclaim their spiritual gifts. For over a decade, I have worked with thousands of clients and students worldwide, teaching:
✨ Nordic Shamanic Healing (Völva traditions & ancestral energy work)
🌿 Angelic & Reiki Healing
🌀 Somatic Healing & Hypnosis
🔮 Soul Coaching & Psychic Development
Through my work, I bridge ancient wisdom with modern spirituality, empowering healers to rise.

🌿 FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions 🌿
🔹 Tell me about your head jewelry?
The headpiece I wear is from Etsy and looks similar to the jewelry found in Viking graves across Sweden, inspired by Roman & Byzantine coin designs used in Norse craftsmanship.
🔹 What do the runes on your hands mean?
I use different Nordic runes to create a protective field around me when I work. Some of the runes I use:
* Algiz (ᛉ) – Protection
* Uruz (ᚢ) – Strength
* Sowilo (ᛋ) – Success
🔹 Can anyone learn this type of energy healing, or do you need to be from the Nordics?
This practice is not closed—if you feel called to this energy, you can learn it. Having Northern European ancestry can deepen your connection, but it is not a requirement. Energy recognizes resonance, not borders.
🔹 How should I watch the video for best success?
Listen to your intuition! 
🌿 Some people prefer to:
* Watch my hand movements and follow along visually.
* Lie down, close their eyes, and receive the energy.
* Keep it on in the background while doing daily tasks.
There is no right or wrong—experiment and notice how your body responds. 🌿✨

ASMR Tracing Your Face with Light Triggers Only 💤🔦 ASMR Bright Lights to Help You Sleep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k8n3zpw1nM,"hi ! 

as you may or may not know, I love light triggers. 

and lately while I’ve been watching my nightly ASMR videos, I’ve been thinking to myself about how I would appreciate an instructional, light touching video. 

I love when lights get really close to the screen and when the movements are almost - touching me. 

so in turn, I have created a face touching ASMR video with lights! 

lol I really hope you enjoy :)

15:50 Hand Movements 
22:45 Tarot Reading
34:14 Singing Bowl 

In this reiki session, I will cleanse your energetic field with a smoke cleanse, followed by a relaxing selenite massage and body scan. We will then pull some cards and contemplate about the idea that perhaps we are more than just our minds and thoughts, all with the intention to detach from negative thoughts and return to calm awareness. Afterwards, you will be guided into sleep with a singing bowl. Hope you enjoy! Much love, Ediya 💛

ASMR for Sleep and Relaxation 😴✨,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur9vbRENpTg,"hi ! 

this ASMR video is great for background noise, something to study to or if you’re wanting a video with minimal talking. 😌 

I actually enjoy making these types of videos and I wish I made more, but I know you all prefer the fast, talking videos. which is totally fine! 

I just hope you’re okay with me venturing out into these types of videos as well 😊🫶🏻 

anyways, I hope you enjoy and I hope to see you soon!

ASMR | Deep Sleep in 30 Minutes 💤 (gentle whispers),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Q7ldIep3o,"Hi guys! This is a whispered asmr video to help with anxiety/stress and fall asleep quickly. 💤 It has a guided breathing meditation, candle burning, ear cleaning, tapping, water sounds, tacky/squishy sounds, personal attention, affirmations, and more. 💜

Sounds and tapping start kind of fast in the beginning and slow down to a gentle, sleepy pace. Hope you enjoy and can fall asleep in less than 30 minutes!

Also, sorry that it's been a bit since I've posted - I've been feeling a little under the weather and also dealing with taxes (other small business owners know how complicated they can get 😝) Schedule of 1-2 videos a week should be back on track soon!

📲WHAT IS THIS?
The spiritual cleansing is perhaps the most widespread tradition in the Ecuadoran Sierra when it comes to seeking health, economic prosperity, family  and more blessings in the year, to get rid of bad energy.

📲WHEN I SHOULD DO THIS?
After accidents, car crashes, having been near dead, when they steal, that gives him bad energy and for that you have to make a good clean with herbs, eggs and of colonies.

📲HEALERS
The art of cleaning is inherited or learned from a young age. Before started it, the cleaner must ensure that he is at peace with all his fellow men so that the bad energy expelled does not enter other beings. You should also know the properties of each herb well.

📲PLANTS
The plants for the clean ones are: Santamaria, Rue, Simbalo, Eucalyptus, Elder, etc.
However, there are also sweet plants, which are: lemon verbena, chamomile, sweet basil a walnut.
The most common titer ones are: rue, rosemary, thyme, drunkenness, hemlock among others.
The plants for hot baths are: matico, walnut, grouper, cypress and eucalyptus.

📲EVIL
The evil eye is when children are restless or when adults are stressed or in a bad mood. There are even discomforts in the stomach.The fright is when they can't sleep and are extremely restless.

ASMR Negative Energy Removal & Positive Affirmations 🥰,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6U6jhaG3Q,"hey guys! welcome back or welcome if you're new!  

my advice is not universal. take what resonates and ignore what doesnt. i wish you all the best always. this is your life. live it the way that brings you happiness. 🥰

FAQs:

what is ASMR? a feeling of well-being combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck, as experienced by some people in response to a specific gentle stimulus, often a particular sound.

what do you study in college? journalism! 

where are you located? east coast of the USA!

why soft spoken? i loveee this type of ASMR and many others do too!!

"ASMR Negative Energy Removal with Scissors ✨ Hand Movements, Hand Sounds and Minimal Talking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgNsIWD_GJQ,"Plucking remains my favorite visual trigger, the first to put me to sleep because it's the derivation of the hand movements I love so much.
I like to mentalize that hand movements are removing negative energy from me or pulling stress away. But the big truth is that I use this type of ASMR when I'm feeling anxious and overthinking things and visual triggers like plucking and hand movements are perfect for those situations. But in this one you will listen to scissors sounds cutting the strings of everything holding you back, could it be stress, anxiety, negative energies, bad thoughts, or even insomnia. I like the scissor sounds with this kind of visual ASMR because it brings more reality to the cutting invisible chords effect.
Other than that, hand sounds and mouth sounds are very present because I like the feeling of relaxation they bring me, even when while recording 🥰
For lovers of mouth sounds no talking, this video has few repetitions of words, and I think it's valid to put it in the category of ASMR Minimal Talking 😅
*The video is looped, but I edited it in a way to make it smooth
I hope you are doing well, see ya 💜

ASMR For When You Can’t Stop Thinking 🫁 (no lights),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPmIVNVp9Cc,"hi! 

when I first started watching asmr I did it because my thoughts would never quiet down. 

I used to suffer from nightmares and would lay awake at night dreading closing my eyes. 

my thoughts clouded my head and left me restless. I’d wake up in the middle of the night more often than not, then the whole process would repeat itself. 

when I found asmr it allowed me to forget my thoughts and really focus on whatever the person was telling me. it relaxed me. 

this relaxation allowed me a moment of peace. asmr quieted my thoughts and allowed me a safe space to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. 

I made this video hoping that my little questions, and occasional direction could quiet your thoughts too. 

I know a lot of people who watch asmr struggle with the same issue. 

I hope you find peace in this video, my friend. 

you are not alone. 

🌱❤️

ASMR When You Can’t Stop Thinking 😶 (Basically I’m your best friend & I distract you for 20 minutes),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wb-nzlSA4M,"hi! 

so in todays video I tried to be a little more upbeat but still tried to keep the ASMR vibe in mind. 

basically, I took on this character because I wanted to provide a happy, safe place for you to come when you’re feeling any negative emotions or experiencing negative thoughts. 

I figured ASMR mixed with random questions would take your mind off of whatever it is that’s going on inside your head. 

please remember that negative feelings pass. emotions always change, and so does your environment. 

choose to see the good in your day and in your life. please. 

I promise there’s so much good to see, if you just look hard enough 🫶🏻 sooner or later seeing the good will become second nature. 

I hope to see you soon, my friend.

Reinventing My Triggers 🥱 Fast ASMR on your Face for Sleep (whispered),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDo6wxpQE6I,"hi! 

I had SO much fun with this video !! 

my goal was to take triggers I don’t normally use and fine some interesting ways to use them for a face touching video. 

honestly, I LOVE face touching / camera tapping / objects in the camera type videos so I really hope I did the concept justice here. 

I’d love to start making some “first person ASMR” videos, kinda like a few of my old TikTok’s but I don’t know if you guys enjoy those or not! 🤔 

you’ll have to let me know. 

anyways, happy new year ????? 🎊

What is ASMR??
ASMR stands for Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). 
It is a feeling of well-being combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck, as experienced by some people in response to a specific gentle stimulus, often a particular sound.

PLEASE NOTE: Even though ASMR can help you relax, it is in NO WAY a substitute for medical/psychological counsel, please reach out to your doctor if you're in need of medical support.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z1j3RI3ZpsQ/sddefault.jpg,tiny hands ASMR,"1 Hours, 51 Minutes, 59 Seconds",2023-07-13T17:30:06

On this occasion we meet Mariana in a public market in Ecuador, where Doña Natividad will perform a Spiritual Cleansing with Strong Massage ASMR to ward off bad energies and relax the body.

📲WHAT IS THIS?
The spiritual cleansing is perhaps the most widespread tradition in the Ecuadoran Sierra when it comes to seeking health, economic prosperity, family  and more blessings in the year, to get rid of bad energy.

📲WHEN I SHOULD DO THIS?
After accidents, car crashes, having been near dead, when they steal, that gives him bad energy and for that you have to make a good clean with herbs, eggs and of colonies.

📲HEALERS
The art of cleaning is inherited or learned from a young age. Before started it, the cleaner must ensure that he is at peace with all his fellow men so that the bad energy expelled does not enter other beings. You should also know the properties of each herb well.

📲PLANTS
The plants for the clean ones are: Santamaria, Rue, Simbalo, Eucalyptus, Elder, etc.
However, there are also sweet plants, which are: lemon verbena, chamomile, sweet basil a walnut.
The most common titer ones are: rue, rosemary, thyme, drunkenness, hemlock among others.
The plants for hot baths are: matico, walnut, grouper, cypress and eucalyptus.

📲EVIL
The evil eye is when children are restless or when adults are stressed or in a bad mood. There are even discomforts in the stomach.The fright is when they can't sleep and are extremely restless.

What is ASMR? 
Autonomous sensory meridian response, sometimes auto sensory meridian response, is a tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. A pleasant form of paresthesia, it has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia and may overlap with frisson.

ASMR Negative Energy Removal 🔮 Soft Spoken,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQq68FmzFU,"hi 

I’m sorry you’re having a bad day, but I hope this video is able to give you some sort of peace. 

The ASMR community is a safe place for people to unwind and distract themselves after a long day. 

This among many other reasons is why I love being apart of the community and why I’m even more grateful to be a creator in this community. 

Stepping off my pedestal for a moment￼ - MY MIC WASNT PLUGGED IN 😭 

I was so disappointed- but honestly the sounds are still there! So I’m not too upset. 

anyways, enjoy & I’ll see you soon 🫶🏻

What is ASMR? 
Autonomous sensory meridian response, sometimes auto sensory meridian response, is a tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. A pleasant form of paresthesia, it has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia and may overlap with frisson.

What is ASMR? 
Autonomous sensory meridian response, sometimes auto sensory meridian response, is a tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. A pleasant form of paresthesia, it has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia and may overlap with frisson.

One of my favorite roleplays of all time is haircutting so I hope you enjoy this longform video. Perfect for falling asleep and staying asleep!!

Healing Frequency Meditation (1111 Hz) | 1 hour handpan music | Malte Marten & Lynxk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_3C0z96GE0,"I am so proud and happy to share this jam with you. Lynxk and I met a couple of weeks ago, when she had just started her handpan journey. In the meantime we did some handpan lessons and started playing gentle jams together. Her talent and openness is amazing and from a teachers perspective it just makes my heart smile to see her progress. We’ve been focusing on the very basics of handpan playing - the foundation of every jam: the chord progression. Goal of the first learning cycle is to deepen the understanding of the continuous change of chords. Next on is to implement new patterns, first percussive elements and little fill-ins to make one and the same pattern sound unique.
On a personal note it is deeply fulfilling to jam with her. The energy shifts as soon as we take the instruments on our labs and start to play. Sending love always ♾️🤍

ASMR Ancient Roman Spa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-qQzeCEGk0,"All my links: https://beacons.ai/spaceunity Hello my cuties 🤍
In this video, you wake up in 100 A.D. and find yourself inside a Roman bathhouse. Steam rising, torches flickering, and me, your healer, ready to bring you back to balance.

I’ll be walking you through a full spa ritual straight from ancient Rome: herbal steam, cleansing clay masks, and the strigil—a tool used to gently scrape the body clean, just like they did back then. The sounds are soft, the visuals are cozy, and the vibes are very much fall asleep in history class but make it aesthetic.

Whether you love ancient rituals, soothing sounds, or you just need a break from the modern world… this one's for you 🕊️🏛️

"Taking Care of You When You’re Sick 🤒 SCI-FI SOLARPUNK ASMR ☀️ [Unusual Remedies, Deep Resonance]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzGJkSDAyZU,"NO MUSIC VERSION: https://youtu.be/7eqNJ06sfLY

You find yourself battling a mysterious illness, one that manifests in an array of strange symptoms—like chromatic sweats, haptic hallucinations, and polarized vision. The city hospital dismissed your case as spring allergies…But I know it’s something more serious than that. After exhaustive research and numerous tests, I've begun to suspect that your condition might be a rare sensitivity to the recent solar flares. Here, in the quietness of my eco-friendly sanctuary, I will care for you. Using my scientific expertise, I am committed to unraveling the mystery of your illness and developing effective remedies. You are the most important person in my life, and I will keep you close—watching over you with unwavering vigilance—until we uncover the truth behind these unusual symptoms. 

When most people think of the futuristic genre, the word “cyberpunk” comes to mind. However, there are many different categories that are similar (dread punk, bio punk, diesel punk). The ""punk"" genres in fiction encompass a variety of settings that mix technology, society, and often politics, each with its own distinctive look and philosophy. For this video, I wanted to focus on “solar punk” which is a genre that envisions a future shaped by sustainability, renewable energy, and a harmonious integration of human society with the natural world. My interpretation of it is that it’s like a future way of life where solar energy is used to power everything, and everyone has a rooftop garden. I initially had the idea of harvesting solar energy through a wand-like device and using it to cure an illness. From that initial idea, I crafted the rest of the story based on that. My way of incorporating the sustainability aspect of this genre was to have this character collect a bunch of vintage objects. I hope you enjoy the ambience section at the end! I love when there's at least 10 minutes of nothing important happening in ASMR videos so I can actually fall asleep. Scratchy pencil sounds are one of my favorites :)

"ASMR Ultimate Nape, Scalp & Hair TINGLES for Deep Sleep (No Talk)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B-33K_mfCc,"Hello hello!🧚🏼‍♀️Today's ASMR video is dedicated to the serene pleasures of nape and scalp attention tingles created without any talking, so you can fully immerse yourself in the ASMR experience without any distractions.

This ASMR video is designed to help you relax, unwind, and relieve stress. We've created a gentle and soothing experience that focuses solely on the nape of your neck, one of the most tension-prone areas of the body, whether that's brushing it, or handling carefully with hands.

So sit back, relax, and let us take care of you!

"ASMR The Most Relaxing Haircut, Shaving, Face Exam, Face Massage RP, Personal Attention",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwV2b6NC8LU,"Hello everyone!  In this ASMR video, there are 3 different RP's that are all connected with each other.  Starts with a haircut then shaving, Face Exam, and Face massage. There is only one intro to the videos and the rest of the RPs I go directly into the point and start the RP.  No need 3 times introducing myself😂 So it's like fast-forwarding to the next one.  I hope you like it.  Please watch it with headphones💖

🍁 Fall is officially here, it’s getting chillier, and it’s time for some cozy layers…for your mind! 

This video has lots of various visuals and layered sounds for you to enjoy. Some are new ones, and there are some old favorites too! I tried to keep with a cozier mood and you’ll see a few autumnal objects and colors, and less flashy visuals this time around. 🕯️

Hope you stay comfy and have a nice week! Until next time, stay well, stay well-rested, and take good care. Sweet dreams, friends! 🍭

I know ASMR can help a lot with problems like anxiety, insomnia, or even depression, but it is not the cure for more severe cases. Please, if you're struggling with any mental illness, don't be afraid to talk to a professional. These videos are made to relax but are not professional help. Mental health is something we all should worry about, so don't be afraid to speak up.

Episode #12 - Unity OR Unreal? Why We Chose Unity & Plastic SCM!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm0YelRkSrw,"🎮 Episode #12 - Unity OR Unreal? Why We Chose Unity & Plastic SCM!

Choosing the right game engine is one of the biggest decisions for any indie dev because you'll be stuck with it for YEARS.
In this episode, I talk about why we chose Unity over Unreal for developing Moonfrost! I also share why we use Plastic SCM for version control—it’s been a game-changer for our team’s workflow.

Unity has been the backbone of our game's development, offering flexibility, a massive asset store, and a supportive community. We also use uMotion, a powerful animation editor from the Unity Asset Store, to streamline our character animations.

9-Hour Draw With Me ✿ Full Webtoon comic page drawing process + Pomodoro Timer 50/10 (Soft Music),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIItGPUBq0M,"✿ ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ  Hi everyone! 

Happy Monday! I hope you all had a restful weekend and are having a great start to your week.

Today I am sharing something a bit... dare I say... crazy (´⊙ω⊙`)! In an effort to kick my butt out of procrastination-mode and motivate myself to get working on my webcomic, I challenged myself to document my *entire* comic-making process — starting from a completely blank canvas to a fully lined and colored comic page from my Webtoon (that is still yet to be released), ""Heart on a Stale Canvas"" (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤

The format of this video was inspired by the many ""study with me"" videos I used to play in the background while studying when I was still in University. I really wanted this video to be like a friend to help motivate you and draw with the entire dayヽ(〃＾▽＾〃)ﾉ 

I included a Pomodoro timer to help break up focus time and break time into 50-minute and 10-minute sessions respectively. The 10-minute break sessions are little chitty-chattys with me explaining a bit about my process and what I accomplished in the preceding focus sessions. I also included a 40-minute lunch break where I film myself preparing and eating some yummy onigiri (rice balls) (ෆ˙ᵕ˙ෆ)♡

There were many ups and downs throughout the filming process (Namely, running into technical difficulties ಥ_ಥ) but I managed to push through nonetheless! I really hope you all enjoy and learn something new about the comic-making process (＾▽＾)

Thank you all so much for watching! 
❤  Riniapple

***Video Editing Note***
I apologize for the audio cutting out a bit periodically during the first break. I'm pretty sure this audio issue is fixed for the rest of the video!

✿ ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ  Hi everyone! 

I hope you're all doing well (❁´▽`❁)*✲ﾟ*  

Today, in this draw-with-me video, I am trying something a little bit different! I scavenged through my old art and found a piece to redraw in my new, updated style! The piece I picked was drawn in 2017— 7 years ago (☉_☉)! 

Watch (or draw) along as I recreate this 7-year-old illustration in real time! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ * As always, I will be using a Pomodoro timer — 50 minutes of focus followed by a 10-minute break.
 
As always, thank you all so much for watching!

Starseeds (1111 Hz) | 1 hour handpan music | Malte Marten & Chantress Seba,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfScQcO4ZU,"I feel incredibly blessed to get to collaborate and play with so many different people. Gemini and Finn of @ChantressSeba are a huge inspiration for me ever since I listened to their music for the first time. Meeting them and create together has been a special experience and I am stoked to release the first song ever that we’ve played together. Finn was supporting the whole recording process, while Gem and I sat down to channel the frequency of the stars, the eternal bliss of the universe.
Immerse yourself into this one hour sound meditation and travel together with us to source. Guided by the spirit of this incredible place somewhere in the vast nature of England. 
Sending love always ♾️🤍

What are you studying and where are you joining from? I also wonder what type of videos you like, study at the library or study at home? Your opinions are quite important to me; and, if you let me know what type of videos you like to watch, I would be happy.

So delighted to share this cozy, deep house mix with you! June is a beautiful time of year here in Lithuania, so I picked some blooming wildflowers, made a cup of lemon balm tea, and played some relaxing, groovy tunes to start off the day on a positive note. You can listen to this set in the morning while enjoying your breakfast, midday to boost focus while working, in the afternoon for a relaxing break, and in the evening to gently unwind. 💐🫖

What is ASMR?
It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Most people experience ASMR in the form of tingles, which is often described as an electrifying sensation down your back. It's very relaxing and comforting but it can go as far as to help with anxiety, sleeping problems and stress. Though ASMR is not a medical treatment and I do not give medical advice.

What mics am I using?
the single mic - Blue Yeti X
the two small ones on a stand - Rode M5-MP
the one that looks like some sort of ghost hunting device - Zoom H5 and SSH-6 capsule
mic with ears - 3Dio FS XLR

Whispered ASMR Plucking and Pulling your Negative Energy 💤,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY61Mo3KWHI,"hi ! 

so, I wanted to create a negative energy video but instead of making what I normally make I decided to take a lot of inspiration from Reiki energy healing videos. 

I tried to incorporate a bit of reiki and my own ASMR style so I think it’s pretty unique. 

I really hope you enjoy … 

If you liked this style, let me know if you’d like me to create an entire reiki based video in the future! 

personally, I love watching hand movements reiki videos. 

now that doesn’t seem like a word anymore… 

reiki … reiki ….

Everything Is Falling Into Place For You ⚡️ Aggressive Spiritual Cleansing & Energy Healing ASMR,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32X0PHKkno,"First Steps to Become an Energy Healer: Free Masterclass ➝ https://home.sannethewitch.com/masterclasswelcome

This Nordic Shamanic Energy Healing is rooted in the traditions of the Viking Witches, the Völvas—mystics, seers, and energy workers who channeled the power of the land. I am Sanne, a Swedish Witch, Energy Master, and Spiritual Guide, working with the sacred currents flowing through the ancient lands of the North.

Like the Völvas before me, I weave together ancestral knowledge, psychic vision, and energy mastery to create powerful healing transmissions.

🧙‍♀️ About Me 🧙‍♀️
I’m Sanne, a Nordic Witch, Psychic Medium, and Energy Master, guiding seekers and healers to reclaim their spiritual gifts. For over a decade, I have worked with thousands of clients and students worldwide, teaching:
✨ Nordic Shamanic Healing (Völva traditions & ancestral energy work)
🌿 Angelic & Reiki Healing
🌀 Somatic Healing & Hypnosis
🔮 Soul Coaching & Psychic Development

Through my work, I bridge ancient wisdom with modern spirituality, empowering healers to rise.

🌿 FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions 🌿
🔹 Tell me about your head jewelry?
The headpiece I wear is from Etsy and looks similar to the jewelry found in Viking graves across Sweden, inspired by Roman & Byzantine coin designs used in Norse craftsmanship.

🔹 What do the runes on your hands mean?
I use different Nordic runes to create a protective field around me when I work. Some of the runes I use:
Algiz (ᛉ) – Protection
Uruz (ᚢ) – Strength
Sowilo (ᛋ) – Success

🔹 Can anyone learn this type of energy healing, or do you need to be from the Nordics?
This practice is not closed—if you feel called to this energy, you can learn it. Having Northern European ancestry can deepen your connection, but it is not a requirement. Energy recognizes resonance, not borders.

🔹 How should I watch the video for best success? 
Listen to your intuition! 
🌿 Some people prefer to:
Watch my hand movements and follow along visually.
Lie down, close their eyes, and receive the energy.
Keep it on in the background while doing daily tasks.
There is no right or wrong—experiment and notice how your body responds. 🌿✨

"Universe Got Your Back!  👁 ⚡️ Aggressive Spiritual Cleansing, Cord Cutting & Energy Healing ASMR",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTfeo2gVPmI,"First Steps to Become an Energy Healer: Free Masterclass ➝ https://home.sannethewitch.com/masterclasswelcome

This Nordic Shamanic Energy Healing is rooted in the traditions of the Viking Witches, the Völvas—mystics, seers, and energy workers who channeled the power of the land. I am Sanne, a Swedish Witch, Energy Master, and Spiritual Guide, working with the sacred currents flowing through the ancient lands of the North.

Like the Völvas before me, I weave together ancestral knowledge, psychic vision, and energy mastery to create powerful healing transmissions.

🧙‍♀️ About Me 🧙‍♀️
I’m Sanne, a Nordic Witch, Psychic Medium, and Energy Master, guiding seekers and healers to reclaim their spiritual gifts. For over a decade, I have worked with thousands of clients and students worldwide, teaching:
✨ Nordic Shamanic Healing (Völva traditions & ancestral energy work)🌿 Angelic & Reiki Healing🌀 Somatic Healing & Hypnosis🔮 Soul Coaching & Psychic Development

Through my work, I bridge ancient wisdom with modern spirituality, empowering healers to rise.

🌿 FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions 🌿
🔹 Tell me about your head jewelry?The headpiece I wear is from Etsy and looks similar to the jewelry found in Viking graves across Sweden, inspired by Roman & Byzantine coin designs used in Norse craftsmanship.

🔹 What do the runes on your hands mean?I use different Nordic runes to create a protective field around me when I work. Some of the runes I use:
* Algiz (ᛉ) – Protection
* Uruz (ᚢ) – Strength
* Sowilo (ᛋ) – Success

🔹 Can anyone learn this type of energy healing, or do you need to be from the Nordics?This practice is not closed—if you feel called to this energy, you can learn it. Having Northern European ancestry can deepen your connection, but it is not a requirement. Energy recognizes resonance, not borders.

🔹 How should I watch the video for best success?Listen to your intuition! 🌿 Some people prefer to:
* Watch my hand movements and follow along visually.
* Lie down, close their eyes, and receive the energy.
* Keep it on in the background while doing daily tasks.
There is no right or wrong—experiment and notice how your body responds. 🌿✨

ASMR Cranial Nerve Exam (I broke),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=134ePQwpkaE,"ASMR Cranial Nerve Exam (I broke)

ASMR Cranial Nerve Exam where I truly tried to be normal about the exam and not do the weird cranial nerve exam stuff I usually do, but it was NOT IT y'all. I immediately started having more fun when I did the typical cranial nerve exams I do and just let whatever happens happen and anything goes! AHHH!! Maybe one day I'll finally make it through an entire exam asmr video without turning it into something that makes no actual sense and is nothing like a real exam. Alas, today was not that day. But also, let me know if I have succeeded at a normal cranial nerve exam asmr and just don't remember?? Cuz then I can link to the video for those who came into this video hoping for an ""actual"" cranial nerve exam. I rarely write descriptions but I'm on desktop right now and love writing on this keyboard lalala

I've been really into reiki, energy healing, and plucking ASMR videos lately. I generally love learning about nature and spirituality and I was inspired to take little elements of those topics and put them in this video to help you relax.. aaand I finally did a soft-spoken asmr. I loved it so much..not gonna lie, soft-spoken videos have always been a little closer to my heart than the whispering ones. I hope you enjoy it, and thank you all! 
here's a big heart of positivity for you

WHAT IS ASMR: ASMR doesn’t work for everyone and it can be tough to imagine the sensation if you don’t experience it first-hand. For most people who do experience it, the blissful tingling starts up in the scalp and then makes its way through the body to the arms and legs. And as a result, it can trigger a feeling of relaxation before bedtime, which can help you overcome insomnia.

Harp in a Giant Redwood Tree: 1 Hour Healing Music | Sarah Bhalla,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZIEQUdSqLQ,"There is no feeling like being in the forest among the giant ancient redwood trees. The air shifts, like you’ve stepped into a world outside of time. Coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest beings on Earth and some of the oldest, living over 2,000 years. 

This beautiful tree endured a severe fire that hollowed out the inside. Redwood bark is incredibly fire-resistant; if enough of the tissue remains, the tree will heal and thrive.  This incredible living being draws many visitors each year, and I felt so humbled to be here, to meet both locals and travelers who love this forest. Many come here routinely to walk among the trees, to feel a connection, and to find healing. 

A few wonderful animals call the forest home, and some even sang along once the music started. Listen closely and you’ll hear owls and the playful Steller’s Jay. To sit within this towering Redwood and feel the harp’s sound vibrate through the tree, it’s hard to put that into words.  There was a deep presence in those moments, shared with the many beautiful souls I met here. This lives close to my heart, and I’m grateful to share these moments.

All of the music is improvised and includes a melody that came to me as a child. This chord structure is one I always return to, one of the first I ever improvised to, and it always feels like coming home.

So much love to you,

Sarah

"*Just Listen for 3 Minutes • SLEEP LIKE A BABY* | Pure Tibetan Singing Bowls, No SoundFX, DIM SCREEN",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozCz-0fFAUc,"Welcome my friend 🙏🏽

This session was recorded with great care and sensitivity. I’ve tried my best to shape the sound waves as smoothly and naturally as possible.

Although the title says it’s for sleep, you can also use it for meditation, deep focus, or even while studying. Let the sounds guide you into whatever state your mind and body need most.

Tibetan singing bowls are unique. They don’t always fit into a standard musical scale. Their beauty lies in their rich overtones, which can sometimes sound dissonant, just like sounds in nature. In this recording, I’ve gently brought out some of those layered overtones to create a deep, emotional texture while still keeping the fundamental tones in harmony.

The deeper bowls were placed closer to the microphones so you can truly feel their low vibrations. These tones help calm your nervous system, support vagus nerve activation, and guide you into a space of peace.

I saw a comment from someone saying that moving your body or getting some exercise helps more than anything and I completely agree. These sounds can support you, but real movement makes a big difference. Even a 15-30 minute walk around your home can help clear your mind and lift your mood.

Many of us do so much for others - family, friends, even peta - but forget to care for ourselves. So today, try to give a little of that care back to yourself too. You deserve it, kind soul. 🌿💛

00:00 Intro & Visuals
06:00 Dim Screen Starts

Adjust the volume to your comfort and let the sounds guide you.

🎧 Best enjoyed with headphones.
🔊 For a soothing experience, I recommend keeping your volume at a comfortable level — around 50–70%, depending on your device.

Thank you so much for being here.

Forest Meditation: 1 Hour Harp Music | Sarah Bhalla,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4tSJKfyjwU,"Wishing you a very happy New Year, full of peace. I’ve been reflecting lately with so much gratitude in my heart. So thankful to God for everything.

I returned to one of my favorite forests over two winter afternoons to record this forest meditation. The light fades so quickly this time of year, so I went back again to catch those last soft rays of afternoon sun. This piece is a prayer from the heart, improvised around a few musical ideas, recorded live alongside the sounds of nature.

I’ve also been trying a new camera lens that brings the small details a little closer. The harp is such a special instrument, you can see the strings moving and vibrating with the music. I would love to hear what you think of the new lens and how it feels to you.

As we step into this new year together, I hope you feel encouraged, held, and surrounded by kindness. I’ve been reflecting on how much it matters to choose grace, toward others and toward ourselves, to keep choosing love.

Wishing you a year filled with peace, joy, and so much love. Thank you, truly, for being here.

A place to rest: Relaxing Ambient Harp 1 Hr | Sarah Bhalla,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6UoiC6Akcg,"An afternoon by the coast, in the last glow of the sun as it moves below the horizon.
A space to breathe, to rest the mind, and to feel peace and calm in the soul.
The gentle sound of the harp joins the distant music of the waves.
A moment to share more of the story of this place, to be held in sound and in this space.
Sending so much love to you.

I hope you enjoy. I'll use a few tools like brushes etc., but mostly just touching the microphone with my hands and whispering as close as I can get! :)

I find that I get a lot of comments and messages about using ASMR for anxiety, depression, and more. I can totally relate with that, and ASMR is an awesome outlet for those things. However, if you’re interested, above is a link to a website with real, professional & licensed counselors. You can type to them, or call them! It’s actually a really cool service and I use it personally. It costs as low as $35 a week, and you don’t have to leave your house to use it. :)

What is ASMR? 
It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Most people experience ASMR in the form of tingles, which is often described as an electrifying sensation down your back. It's very relaxing and comforting but it can go as far as to help with anxiety, sleeping problems and stress. Though ASMR is not a medical treatment and I do not give medical advice.

What mics am I using?
the single mic - Blue Yeti X
the two small ones on a stand - Rode M5-MP
the one that looks like some sort of ghost hunting device - Zoom H5 and SSH-6 capsule
mic with ears - 3Dio FS XLR
tinier single mic - Fifine K690

You Deserve This… Warm Oil Hand Massage ASMR,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X16ee8fIAs8,"Come closer… let me take your hands 🤍
In this ASMR video, I slowly massage your hands using warm, silky oil — gentle pressure, smooth gliding movements, and soft sounds designed to calm your body and quiet your mind.

You’ll hear delicate oil sounds, slow hand movements, and my soft voice guiding you into deep relaxation. This is a moment of pure care and personal attention — unhurried, intimate, and comforting.

Perfect for when you need to unwind, feel cared for, or drift peacefully into sleep.

Relax your hands… slow your breathing…
You don’t need to do anything else right now 🤍

What is ASMR?
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (often abbreviated as ASMR) is a neologism that emerged from internet culture, describing a sensory phenomenon characterized by a distinct pleasant tingling sensation on the scalp or other parts of the body in response to certain visual, auditory, or cognitive stimuli. This content is used for relaxation or light immersion into sleep.
